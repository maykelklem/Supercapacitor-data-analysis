## Overview:

This straightforward program has been created to calculate capacitance based on galvanostatic charge/discharge data.

## File Setup:

Ensure that your data file adheres to the following specifications:

- The file should consist of two columns: "Time (s)" and "Voltage (V)," in that precise order.
- Use the exact column headings **Time (s)** and **Voltage (V)** (without quotation marks).
- The discharge current must be specified in Amperes (A) for the program to provide capacitance in Farads (F).

## Usage:

1. Prepare your data file following the specified format (.csv).
2. Run the code, ensuring the correct discharge current is set in Amperes.
